SimpleStore
This is a little project to manage the store with powerful options. written on php and js, simple to manage, no need sql.
I start this project after starting use telegram channel to buy meat online, the problem was that they don't have any site or form to order they products, just long list with prices. At the start of this project, I have already received more than 200 orders from the store's customers in the first two weeks. The project is not over, but I will try :)


                            <div>
                                A lot of people use social media to sell their products.
                                They use different ways to show their list of products, each time struggling with this design and update.
                                And their customers have to rewrite or copy the names of the goods in their personal correspondence for the order.
                                <p>I made a simple application with the following functions:</p>
                            </div>
                            <ol>
                                <h6>for the user:</h6>
                                <li>adding up to 10 products to the list</li>
                                <li>sending the list via WhatsApp by clicking on the send button</li>
                            </ol>
                            <ol>
                                <h6>for the administrator <b class="text-danger">after entering the password:</b></h6>
                                <li>editing store data</li>
                                <li>adding/deleteing categories</li>
                                <li>edit names of categories</li>
                                <li>adding/deleteing products categories</li>
